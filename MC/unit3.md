# Q1(a). Compare Proactive Routing Protocols with Reactive Routing Protocols

## Introduction

Routing protocols in **MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network)** are classified into three types: **Proactive (Table-Driven)**, **Reactive (On-Demand)**, and **Hybrid**. The fundamental difference lies in *when* and *how* routes are discovered and maintained.

---

## Main Answer

### Proactive (Table-Driven) Routing

- Nodes **continuously maintain routing tables** for all possible destinations.
- Routes are **pre-computed** and stored before any data transmission.
- **Examples:** DSDV (Destination Sequenced Distance Vector), OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing).
- Periodic **control message broadcasts** update routing tables across all nodes.
- Route is **immediately available** when data needs to be sent.
- Consumes **more bandwidth and battery** due to constant updates.

### Reactive (On-Demand) Routing

- Routes are **discovered only when needed** — triggered by data transmission.
- No pre-maintained routing tables; routes are **computed on-demand**.
- **Examples:** AODV (Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector), DSR (Dynamic Source Routing).
- Route discovery involves **flooding RREQ** (Route Request) packets.
- **Lower overhead** but introduces **route discovery delay**.
- More suitable for **sparse and highly mobile** networks.

---

## Comparison Table

| Parameter | Proactive Routing | Reactive Routing |
|---|---|---|
| **Route Maintenance** | Continuously maintained (always up-to-date) | Created on-demand (only when needed) |
| **Routing Table** | Pre-computed for all destinations | No table; computed per request |
| **Bandwidth Overhead** | High (periodic updates consume bandwidth) | Low (control packets only on demand) |
| **Route Discovery Delay** | No delay — route instantly available | Delay due to RREQ/RREP flooding |
| **Battery Consumption** | High (constant broadcasting drains battery) | Low (less overhead saves power) |
| **Scalability** | Poor (overhead grows with network size) | Better for large, sparse networks |
| **Suitability** | Low-mobility, stable networks | High-mobility, dynamic networks |
| **Examples** | DSDV, OLSR, WRP | AODV, DSR, TORA |
| **Memory Usage** | High (maintains full routing table) | Low (stores only active routes) |
| **Stale Routes** | Possible (node moves before update) | Less likely (route freshly computed) |

OVERHEAD: HIGH (always)             OVERHEAD: LOW (on need)
```

---

## Example

**Proactive Example (DSDV):**
- Node A maintains a table: `{B: via B, C: via B→C, D: via D, E: via D→E}`
- When A wants to send to E, it looks up the table — no waiting.

**Reactive Example (AODV):**
- Node A wants to send data to E (unknown route).
- A floods RREQ → intermediate nodes forward it → E replies with RREP → route stored temporarily.

---

## Conclusion

**Proactive routing** is preferred in **low-mobility, delay-sensitive** applications where immediate route availability is critical. **Reactive routing** is better for **highly mobile, bandwidth-constrained** MANETs where minimizing overhead is the priority.

# Q1(b). How does AODV Route Data? What are its Advantages and Disadvantages?

## Introduction

**AODV (Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector)** is a **reactive (on-demand) unicast routing protocol** for MANETs. It was developed by **C. E. Perkins and E. M. Royer** and is defined in **RFC 3561**. AODV discovers routes only when required, uses **sequence numbers** to avoid loops, and discards stale routes automatically.

---

## Main Answer

### AODV Message Types

| Message | Full Form | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **RREQ** | Route Request | Broadcast by source to find destination |
| **RREP** | Route Reply | Unicast reply from destination/intermediate node |
| **RERR** | Route Error | Notifies source about broken links |
| **HELLO** | Hello Message | Periodic neighbor detection beacon |

---

### AODV Route Discovery Process (Step-by-Step)

#### Phase 1 — Route Request (RREQ)

1. **Source node A** wants to send data to **Destination E** but has no route.
2. A creates an **RREQ packet** containing:
   - Source IP, Source Sequence Number
   - Destination IP, Destination Sequence Number
   - Broadcast ID (unique per RREQ)
3. A **broadcasts RREQ** to all neighbors.
4. **Intermediate nodes** (B, C, D) forward RREQ if it is fresh (not seen before).
5. Each intermediate node creates a **reverse route** back to source A.
6. Duplicate RREQs (same Source IP + Broadcast ID) are **discarded**.

#### Phase 2 — Route Reply (RREP)

1. **Destination E** (or an intermediate node with a fresh enough route to E) receives RREQ.
2. E generates an **RREP packet** containing:
   - Destination IP, Destination Sequence Number
   - Hop Count (distance to destination)
   - Lifetime (how long the route is valid)
3. RREP is sent **unicast** back along the reverse path to A.
4. Intermediate nodes update their **forward route table** toward E as RREP passes.

#### Phase 3 — Data Transmission

1. Source A receives RREP and **installs the route** to E.
2. **Data packets** are forwarded along the established path.
3. Route entries have a **lifetime** — they expire if unused.

#### Phase 4 — Route Error (RERR)

1. If a **link breaks** (node moves away / fails), the detecting node sends **RERR**.
2. RERR propagates upstream toward source A.
3. Source A must **restart route discovery** if it needs to continue sending data.

### Advantages of AODV

1. **On-Demand Route Discovery** — No unnecessary route maintenance; saves bandwidth.
2. **Loop-Free Routing** — Uses **sequence numbers** to ensure freshness and avoid routing loops.
3. **Unicast, Multicast, Broadcast Support** — Supports all traffic types.
4. **Self-Healing** — Automatically detects broken links via RERR and rediscovers routes.
5. **Scales to Large Networks** — Lower overhead compared to proactive protocols in large MANETs.
6. **No Source Routing** — Route stored in routing tables; packet headers remain small.
7. **Sequence Numbers** — Prevent stale routes and count-to-infinity problem.

### Disadvantages of AODV

1. **Route Discovery Latency** — Initial delay before data can be sent (RREQ flooding takes time).
2. **RREQ Flooding Overhead** — Flooding consumes bandwidth; causes **broadcast storm** in dense networks.
3. **Intermediate Node Vulnerability** — Intermediate nodes can reply with stale routes if sequence numbers are misconfigured.
4. **Not Suitable for Low-Latency Applications** — The discovery delay makes it poor for real-time voice/video in highly mobile networks.
5. **Route Breaks in High Mobility** — Frequent RERR messages and re-discovery in fast-moving nodes.
6. **No QoS Support** — AODV does not natively support Quality of Service guarantees.

---

## Example

**Scenario:** Military field operation — 5 soldiers (A, B, C, D, E) with mobile devices.

- Soldier A wants to send a command to Soldier E.
- A broadcasts RREQ → B forwards → C forwards → D forwards → E receives.
- E sends RREP unicast: E→D→C→B→A.
- A sends encrypted command data via A→B→C→D→E.
- If Soldier D moves out of range, RERR is sent to A, and A rediscovers route.

---

## Conclusion

**AODV** is one of the most widely used MANET routing protocols due to its **on-demand nature, loop-free guarantee via sequence numbers, and self-healing capability**. It is standardized in RFC 3561 and is the foundation for many modern wireless mesh network implementations.

# Q1(c). What is Hybrid Routing? Explain Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) with Diagram

## Introduction

**Hybrid Routing** combines the advantages of both **proactive (table-driven)** and **reactive (on-demand)** routing. It uses proactive routing **within a defined zone** and reactive routing **between zones**. The most well-known hybrid protocol is **ZRP (Zone Routing Protocol)** proposed by **Haas and Pearlman (1997)**.

---

## Main Answer

### What is Hybrid Routing?

- **Proactive routing:** efficient for nearby destinations (no discovery delay).
- **Reactive routing:** efficient for far destinations (avoids excessive table maintenance).
- **Hybrid routing:** uses proactive within a "zone" and reactive beyond it.
- Goal: **reduce control overhead** while maintaining **low latency for local traffic**.

---

### Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP)

ZRP divides the network into **overlapping zones** centered at each node.

#### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Zone** | All nodes within **radius r hops** from a node form its zone |
| **Zone Radius (r)** | Configurable parameter; determines zone size |
| **Intrazone Nodes** | Nodes within the zone radius |
| **Interzone Nodes** | Nodes outside the zone radius |
| **IARP** | IntrAzone Routing Protocol — proactive within zone |
| **IERP** | IntErzone Routing Protocol — reactive between zones |
| **BRP** | Bordercast Resolution Protocol — queries border nodes |

#### ZRP Sub-Protocols

**1. IARP (IntrAzone Routing Protocol)**
- Proactively maintains routes to all nodes **within the zone**.
- Each node knows the exact path to every node within r hops.
- Uses periodic updates like DSDV/OLSR within zone.
- Reduces scope of proactive updates (only zone, not entire network).

**2. IERP (IntErzone Routing Protocol)**
- Reactively discovers routes to nodes **outside the zone**.
- Uses **bordercasting** — queries border nodes of the zone first.
- Border nodes are nodes at exactly **r hops** from source.
- Each border node checks its own zone for the destination.
- If found, the route is returned; otherwise, their border nodes are queried.

**3. BRP (Bordercast Resolution Protocol)**
- Handles the **interzone query propagation**.
- Prevents duplicate queries using **query detection** mechanism.
- Uses coverage lists to avoid re-querying already-covered nodes.

   │  2. IERP: A bordercasts to border nodes (2 hops)   │

### Advantages of ZRP

1. **Reduced Overhead** — Proactive updates limited to zone; not entire network.
2. **Low Latency for Local Traffic** — Intrazone routes instantly available.
3. **Scalable** — Suitable for both small and large MANETs by tuning zone radius.
4. **Flexible Zone Radius** — r can be adjusted based on network density and mobility.
5. **No Duplicate Discovery** — BRP prevents re-querying already-covered regions.

### Disadvantages of ZRP

1. **Zone Radius Tuning** — Choosing optimal r is difficult and network-dependent.
2. **Overlapping Zone Overhead** — Adjacent zones may repeatedly exchange the same information.
3. **IARP Maintenance Cost** — Proactive updates within zone still consume bandwidth.
4. **Complex Implementation** — Three sub-protocols (IARP, IERP, BRP) increase complexity.

---

## Example

**Scenario:** University campus MANET

- r = 2 hops for all nodes.
- Student A (node A) wants to reach Professor F in another building.
- Within A's zone: A knows paths to B, C, D, E (classrooms nearby) via IARP.
- For Professor F (outside zone): A uses IERP — bordercasts to border nodes D and E.
- D's zone includes F. D replies with the route.
- Full path: A → D → F established.

---

## Conclusion

**ZRP** elegantly combines the strengths of proactive and reactive routing. By confining proactive maintenance to a local zone and using reactive discovery beyond it, ZRP achieves **better scalability, lower overhead, and reduced route discovery latency** compared to purely proactive or reactive protocols.

**Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs)** are self-configuring, infrastructure-less networks of mobile devices. Their unique ability to function without a central base station makes them invaluable in diverse real-world scenarios — from life-saving military operations to everyday personal networking.

---

## Main Answer

### 1. Military and Defense Operations

- **Most critical** application of MANET.
- Soldiers in the battlefield cannot rely on fixed infrastructure (which may be destroyed).
- MANET enables **command and control communication** between units.
- Supports **real-time intelligence sharing**, GPS coordination, and tactical decisions.
- **Resistant to single point of failure** — if one node (soldier) is lost, network re-routes.
- Example: US military uses JTRS (Joint Tactical Radio System) based on MANET principles.

### 2. Disaster Recovery and Emergency Services

- After **earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes**, cellular infrastructure is often destroyed.
- MANET enables **first responders, police, paramedics, and firefighters** to communicate.

# Q2(c). Explain DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) — How it Routes Data, Advantages and Disadvantages

## Introduction

**DSR (Dynamic Source Routing)** is a **reactive (on-demand) routing protocol** for MANETs proposed by **David B. Johnson and David A. Maltz** at Carnegie Mellon University. The key distinguishing feature of DSR is **source routing** — the complete path from source to destination is embedded in the **packet header itself**, rather than being stored in intermediate node routing tables.

---

## Main Answer

### Key Concept: Source Routing

- In DSR, the **source node determines the complete route** to the destination.
- The **full sequence of intermediate nodes** (e.g., A → B → C → D → E) is stored in the **packet header**.
- Intermediate nodes simply **read the next hop from the header** and forward accordingly.
- Eliminates the need for intermediate nodes to maintain routing tables.

### DSR Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Route Discovery** | Process to find a route when none is known |

### DSR Route Discovery Process (Step-by-Step)

#### Phase 1 — Route Request (RREQ)

1. **Source A** needs to reach **Destination E** — no route in cache.
2. A creates **RREQ** containing:
   - Source address, Destination address
   - **Route Record field** (initially empty)
   - Unique Request ID
3. A broadcasts RREQ.
4. Each **intermediate node** appends its **own address to the Route Record** before forwarding.
5. By the time RREQ reaches E, Route Record contains: `[A, B, C, D]`
6. Duplicate RREQs (same Source + Request ID, already seen) are **dropped**.

#### Phase 2 — Route Reply (RREP)

1. **Destination E** receives RREQ with Route Record = `[A, B, C, D]`.
2. E generates **RREP** containing the complete route: `[A, B, C, D, E]`
3. RREP is sent back to A — either:
   - By reversing the route: E → D → C → B → A (if links are bidirectional)
   - Or by initiating a new route discovery if links are **unidirectional**
4. A receives RREP and **caches the complete route**.

#### Phase 3 — Data Transmission

1. A sends data packets with **full source route in header**: `[B, C, D, E]`
2. Intermediate nodes read header to find the next hop:
   - B reads header → forwards to C
   - C reads header → forwards to D
   - D reads header → forwards to E
3. **No routing tables** needed at B, C, D — just header reading!

#### Phase 4 — Route Maintenance

1. If a **link breaks** (e.g., D cannot reach E), D sends **RERR** to A.
2. A **removes the broken route** from its cache.
3. A may use an **alternate cached route** or restart Route Discovery.
4. Intermediate nodes **overhear route information** and update their caches (called **promiscuous caching**).

       DSR ROUTE DISCOVERY AND DATA TRANSMISSION

RREQ PHASE (Broadcast with Route Record):
─────────────────────────────────────────
Source A                                      Destination E
   |                                                |
   |--RREQ [Record: A]---> B                        |
   |                       |--RREQ [Record: A,B]--> C
   |                                                |--RREQ [Record: A,B,C]--> D
   |                                                                           |
   |                                                                           |--RREQ [Record: A,B,C,D]--> E
   |                                                                           |
   |<----- RREP [Route: A,B,C,D,E] <---- (E sends back via D,C,B) -----------|

DATA TRANSMISSION (Source Route in Header):
────────────────────────────────────────────
   A (Header: [B,C,D,E]) --> B --> C --> D --> E

   Each intermediate node reads next hop from packet header.
   No routing table required at B, C, D.

ROUTE CACHE (Promiscuous):
──────────────────────────
   Node B overhears: D→E link exists → caches D→E route.
   Useful for future routing decisions.

### Difference: DSR vs AODV

| Feature | DSR | AODV |
|---|---|---|
| **Route Storage** | Full path in packet header | Distributed in routing tables |
| **Intermediate Node Table** | Not required | Required |
| **Packet Header Size** | Larger (full path embedded) | Smaller |
| **Route Caching** | Aggressive (promiscuous caching) | Minimal |
| **Link Type** | Handles unidirectional links | Assumes bidirectional links |
| **Scalability** | Poor (header grows with path length) | Better for large networks |
| **Suitable For** | Small to medium MANETs | Medium to large MANETs |

---

### Advantages of DSR

1. **No Routing Tables at Intermediate Nodes** — Simplifies intermediate node design; saves memory.
2. **Loop-Free by Design** — Source route is explicit; no routing loops possible.
3. **Multiple Routes Cached** — Nodes cache multiple routes; can switch if one breaks without re-discovery.
4. **Promiscuous Caching** — Nodes overhear routes from other transmissions and cache them — reduces RREQ flooding.
5. **Supports Unidirectional Links** — Unlike AODV, DSR can operate on asymmetric links.
6. **On-Demand** — No unnecessary routing overhead when no data is being sent.
7. **Intermediate Route Salvaging** — If a link breaks, an intermediate node may find an alternate path from its cache without notifying source.

### Disadvantages of DSR

1. **Large Packet Headers** — As path length grows, header size grows significantly — wastes bandwidth.
2. **Stale Cache Problem** — Cached routes may become invalid in high-mobility environments; causes packet loss.
3. **Route Discovery Latency** — Delay before first data packet can be sent.
4. **Cache Inconsistency** — Different nodes may cache conflicting route information.
5. **Scalability Issues** — In large networks, RREQ flooding and large headers degrade performance.
6. **Processing Overhead** — Every intermediate node must parse and update packet headers at every hop.

## Example

**Scenario:** Emergency network with 5 nodes: Ambulance (A), Hospital Gate (B), Corridor (C), Ward (D), ICU (E).

- A wants to send patient data to ICU E.
- A has no cached route → broadcasts RREQ.
- RREQ accumulates route: A → B → C → D → E.
- ICU E replies with full route: RREP contains `[A,B,C,D,E]`.
- A sends patient vitals with header: `[B,C,D,E]`.
- Each relay node reads header and forwards — no routing tables needed.
- If Ward D to ICU E link breaks, D sends RERR, A tries cached alternate via `[B,F,E]` if available.

---

## Conclusion

**DSR** is a powerful, loop-free reactive protocol ideal for **small to medium MANETs** where network topology changes moderately. Its source routing mechanism eliminates routing tables at intermediate nodes but introduces packet header overhead. DSR's **aggressive caching strategy** reduces route discovery frequency, making it competitive with AODV in stable network conditions.
